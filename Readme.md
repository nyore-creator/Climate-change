# Climate Change Risk Reduction Platform

This project is a full‑stack web application built to support climate change risk reduction by tapping into indigenous knowledge and identifying hotspot areas vulnerable to climate risks. The platform empowers communities, researchers, and policymakers by providing a space where local insights can be collected, climate risk data can be submitted, and hotspot regions can be monitored in a collaborative way. By combining modern web technologies with traditional knowledge, the system aims to create a practical tool for resilience and adaptation.

The application is structured as a frontend and backend working together. The frontend is built with React using Vite for fast development and deployment, styled for a clean and engaging user experience, and connected to the backend through secure API calls. The backend is developed with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB Atlas for scalable data storage. Authentication is handled with JWT and bcrypt to ensure secure access. Users can register, sign in, and once authenticated, gain access to protected routes such as Home, About, Submit Data, and the Admin Dashboard. The Admin Dashboard provides oversight of submissions and hotspot monitoring, while the Submit Data page allows communities to contribute indigenous knowledge and climate risk information.

Deployment is split between Render and Vercel. The backend is deployed to Render as a web service, with environment variables configured for MongoDB connection strings, JWT secrets, and token expiry. The frontend is deployed to Vercel, with build output from Vite directed to the `dist` folder. Environment variables in Vercel point the frontend to the backend API URL hosted on Render, ensuring seamless communication between the two services. This setup allows the platform to be accessible globally with minimal configuration.

The project uses `.gitignore` files to keep sensitive and unnecessary files out of version control. In the backend, `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules`, `.env`, build artifacts, logs, and system files. In the frontend, `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules`, environment files, the `dist` build output, and system files. These files are placed at the root of each respective folder (`/backend/.gitignore` and `/frontend/.gitignore`) to ensure clean deployments.

This platform directly contributes to several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It advances **SDG 13: Climate Action** by enabling communities to adapt and build resilience through indigenous knowledge and hotspot monitoring. It supports **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** by helping reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen local resilience. It contributes to **SDG 15: Life on Land** by amplifying indigenous practices that protect ecosystems and biodiversity. It aligns with **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals** by fostering collaboration between communities, researchers, and policymakers. Finally, it promotes **SDG 4: Quality Education** by documenting and sharing indigenous knowledge, ensuring that traditional wisdom is valued and passed on.

This plartform can also help in resource mobilization if the backend data is well analyzed and submitted to partners.

Future enhancements include integration of GIS mapping for hotspot visualization, a community forum for indigenous knowledge sharing, analytics dashboards for climate risk trends, and role‑based access to differentiate between admins, researchers, and community members. The project is licensed under MIT, encouraging collaboration and open contribution. Developers and contributors can fork the repository, create feature branches, and submit pull requests to improve the platform.

In summary, this platform is a practical tool for climate change risk reduction, combining modern web development with indigenous knowledge systems. It provides secure authentication, protected dashboards, and a clear deployment path to Render and Vercel, making it a scalable and impactful solution for communities and researchers working on climate resilience, while directly advancing global SDGs.
